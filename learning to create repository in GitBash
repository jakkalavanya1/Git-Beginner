learning to create repository 2 //created this line when the repository was created
I want to add more tho this repository when I  entered into this repositroy from my desktop and used vim README.md command to open this and do additions/deletions. This is awesome

this is VIM where u can use arrow buttons to move, add text, to insert you should use 'i' or 'insert' to strat typing here

At the bottom of the page there is INSERT, which means we are in 'Insert Monde' while entering the data .

to save this press escape to get out of all modes. 

at the bottom you can use ':q' to quit without saving
or ':x' to quit and save. press enter and it is saved

now if you go back and open the folder readme.md it shows the updated text in notepad.

here we can generally write introduction of what this repository is about so that people who have a look at this can have an idea what this is about
